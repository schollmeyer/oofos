# oofos
The R package oofos (optimization on fanilies of sets) provides functions for the optimization of linear functions on families of sets (e.g., closure systems, rings of sets and local rings of sets).
For this, the language of formal concept analysis is used. For the concrete implementation a mixed integer formulation (for closure systems) or a linear programming formulation (for (local) rings of sets) is used (cf., https://www.foundstat.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/mitglieder/schollmeyer/research/tr_209.pdf p.19ff for closure systems and rings of sets and https://georgschollmeyer.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/8/4/138402857/starshaped_subgroup_discovery.pdf for local rings of sets).
The actual computation uses the professional software gurobi ( https://www.gurobi.com ) for which free academic licenses ( https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/ ) are available.

# Installation

You can install the development version of oofos from GitHub with:

``` r


# You have to manually install the R package RBGL via:
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("RBGL")


# You also have to install gurobi and load it:
library(gurobi)

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("schollmeyer/oofos")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to optimize a linear function (given by the vector 'objective') on the closure system of all extents of the concept lattice generated by the context 'context':

``` r
library(oofos)
context <- matrix(c(1,1,0,0,1,0,1,
	      	    1,0,0,0,0,1,0,
	      	    0,1,0,0,0,0,0,
	      	    0,1,0,1,0,0,0,
	            0,1,0,1,0,0,0,
	      	    0,0,1,1,1,0,0,
	      	    0,0,0,0,0,1,0,
	      	    0,0,0,0,0,1,0,
	      	    0,1,0,1,0,0,0,
	      	    1,0,1,0,0,1,0), nrow = 10, ncol = 7, byrow = TRUE)
	      
objective <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) - 5.5
model <- optimize_on_context_extents(context,(1:10),objective)
result <- gurobi(model)

> result$x
[1] 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
 
> result$objval
[1] 5

# For this example the R package CDM (Cognitive Diagnosis Modeling) must be installed.
dat <- na.omit(CDM::data.timss07.G4.lee$data)
context <- dat[,-(1:3)]
target <- compute_objective (dat,"girl",0)
model <- optimize_on_context_extents(context,(1:344),target)
result <- gurobi(model)
result$objval

```
