# oofos
The R package oofos (optimization on fanilies of sets) provides functions for the optimization of linear functions on families of sets (e.g., closure systems, rings of sets and local rings of sets).
For this, the language of formal concept analysis is used. The concrete implementation uses a mixed integer formulation (for closure systems) or a linear programming formulation (for (local) rings of sets is used.
For the concrete computation we use the professional software gurobi ( https://www.gurobi.com ) for which free academic licenses ( https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/ )are available.
